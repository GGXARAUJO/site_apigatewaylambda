### Explanation of Interactions

1. **The user accesses the application through a CloudFront URL.**
    
    - **CloudFront** distributes the static content from the S3 bucket.
2. **If the application needs to make a backend call, it sends an HTTP request to an API Gateway endpoint.**
    
    - **API Gateway** receives the HTTP request.
    - **API Gateway** invokes the configured Lambda function.
3. **The Lambda function processes the request.**
    
    - **Lambda** executes the backend logic and returns a response to the API Gateway.
4. **API Gateway sends the response back to the client.** 
   Hello from Lambda!
    

### Security and Monitoring

- **Security**:
    
    - Use IAM policies to restrict permissions.
    - Configure only HTTPS for CloudFront and API Gateway.
    - Configure the use of DNS and SSL for the necessary domain.
    - Use AWS WAF to protect against common web threats.
- **Monitoring**:
    
    - Enable CloudWatch Logs for Lambda and API Gateway.
    - Configure metrics and alarms in CloudWatch to monitor performance and errors.
